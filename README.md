# PlaySurfer ðŸŒŠ

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I just started this project called PlaySurfer and it is in the beginning stages of production! I am currently working on frontend designing using Figma so I can get a glimpse of how I want my product to look like before I start coding. This will be a full-stack social media application with the aim of connecting athletes on a deeper level. It will promote athletes who play different sports to connect with people within their area or their communities by allowing everyone to share their progress, their accomplishments, but most of all, post the times they are available to play. This way, your friends can request to join your group / event, and it can also make finding that last player much easier. Stay tuned for more about this project, it will be my work in progress this summer!
