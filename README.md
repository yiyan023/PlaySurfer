# PlaySurfer ðŸŒŠ

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I just started my project PlaySurfer, which is in the beginning stages of production! I am currently working on front-end userface using React and Typescript to visualize my product before development. Playsurfer will be a full-stack social media application to connect athletes on a deeper level by allowing everyone to share their progress and accomplishments. This project is unique because users can post their availability for tournaments, free play, training, and other sporting events. Friends can request to join, which makes finding that last player much easier when you want to play outside your training programs. Stay tuned for more about this project - so excited to share it when it's complete!
